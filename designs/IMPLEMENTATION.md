# Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the `acroform` library according to the `designs/PLAN.md`.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New `acroform` Crate
- Created a separate crate in `acroform/` that depends on the `pdf` crate
- **No modifications** were made to the forked `pdf` crate code
- Clean separation allows easy merging of upstream updates

### 2. Field Traversal (Phase 1)
Located in `acroform/src/field.rs`:

- **`FieldDictionaryExt` trait**:
  - `get_full_name()`: Resolves hierarchical field names by walking up parent chain
  - `traverse_field_refs()`: Recursively finds all terminal fields
  
- **`InteractiveFormDictionaryExt` trait**:
  - `all_fields()`: Returns flat list of all terminal fields in the form
  - `find_field_by_name()`: Locates a specific field by its full name

### 3. Field Value Handling (Phase 2)
Located in `acroform/src/api.rs`:

- **`FieldValue` enum**: Type-safe representation of field values
  - `Text(String)` - for text fields
  - `Boolean(bool)` - for checkboxes
  - `Choice(String)` - for radio buttons and dropdowns
  - `Integer(i32)` - for numeric fields
  
- **Conversion methods**:
  - `from_primitive()`: Converts PDF primitives to FieldValue
  - `to_primitive()`: Converts FieldValue back to PDF primitives

### 4. High-Level API (Phase 3)
Located in `acroform/src/api.rs`:

- **`AcroFormDocument` struct**: Main API wrapper around `CachedFile<Vec<u8>>`
  
- **Three-step API**:
  1. `from_pdf(path)`: Load a PDF file
  2. `fields()`: List all fillable fields
  3. `fill_and_save(values, output)`: Update fields and save

- **`FormField` struct**: High-level field representation with:
  - `name`: Full hierarchical field name
  - `field_type`: Field type (Text, Button, Choice, Signature)
  - `current_value`: Optional current value
  - `flags`: Field flags

### 5. Testing
- **Unit tests** in `src/api.rs` and `src/field.rs`
- **Integration tests** in `tests/integration_test.rs`:
  - `test_load_and_list_fields`: Verifies field enumeration
  - `test_fill_and_save`: Verifies round-trip field update
  - `test_nonexistent_field`: Tests robustness
- **Example** in `examples/simple_fill.rs`: Complete working demonstration

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. No Forked Code Modifications
All new functionality is in the separate `acroform` crate using extension traits:
- `FieldDictionaryExt` extends `FieldDictionary` from pdf crate
- `InteractiveFormDictionaryExt` extends `InteractiveFormDictionary` from pdf crate
- Maintains clean separation and allows upstream merging

### 2. Borrowing Strategy
To avoid lifetime issues and borrowing conflicts:
- Field traversal returns `Vec<RcRef<FieldDictionary>>` (owned references)
- Update collection phase separated from mutation phase
- Resolver borrowed only when needed, dropped before mutations

### 3. Type Safety
- `FieldValue` enum provides compile-time type checking
- Automatic conversion between high-level types and PDF primitives
- Prevents mismatched value types

### 4. NeedAppearances Flag
- Relies on existing `/NeedAppearances true` in test PDF
- PDF viewers regenerate field appearances automatically
- No custom appearance stream generation needed

### 5. Non-Incremental Writing
- Always writes complete PDF using `File::save_to()`
- Simpler implementation
- Easier to audit
- Sufficient for most use cases

## Verification

Successfully tested with `acroform_files/af8.pdf`:
1. Loaded PDF and listed all fields
2. Updated field value from "OLD_VALUE" to "NEW_VALUE"
3. Saved modified PDF
4. Verified with `qpdf` that value was updated correctly

All tests pass:
- 2 unit tests
- 3 integration tests
- 1 documentation test

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Can load PDF with AcroForm  
✅ Can list all fillable fields with names and types  
✅ Can update text field values  
✅ Can update checkbox/radio button states (supported by FieldValue enum)  
✅ Can save modified PDF that opens correctly  
✅ Generated PDFs show updated values when opened  

## Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)

The following were explicitly marked as non-goals in PLAN.md:
- PDF rendering or visual preview
- Incremental updates
- Appearance stream generation
- Digital signatures
- XFA forms
- JavaScript evaluation
- PDF creation from scratch
- Form field creation/deletion
